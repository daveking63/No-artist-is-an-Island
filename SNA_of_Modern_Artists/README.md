<h3>SNA of Modern Artists and Movements: Phase 1</h3>

The first phase of this project is devoted to an analysis and visualization of the <i>influence</i> relationships among the "Key" artists of <i>Modern Art</i>. Succinctly stated, the primary goals of this phase are two-fold.  The first goal of this project is to create a "interactive" social network graph of the relationships. The second is to use this graph along with graph theory to visualize, detect, and analyze the patterns of relations in the network.  The fundamentals of this sort of SNA are detailed in a variety of sources dealing with SNA, as well as others dealing with more general network analysis and graph theory (including a short entry in one of my other repositories -- <a href= 'https://github.com/daveking63/Rudiments-of-Social-Network-Analysis/blob/master/README.md'><i>Rudiments of Social Network Analysis</i></a>.

<h3>Building a Graph of Influence Relationships</h3>

As noted in the <a href= 'https://github.com/daveking63/No-artist-is-an-island/blob/master/README.md'><i>Introductory README to this repository</i></a>, the base data on which this graph is built comes from a series of *influence and connections* charts for individual artists found at The ArtStory website." Unlike the linkages provided in the Getty Union List of Artist Names (ULAN) -- which is essentially a straightforward, searchable database listing by artist name -- the information found in The ArtStory is more narrative in form and buried in the various tags and content underling the individual HTML pages devoted to each artist.
