The first goal of this project is to create a social network graph of the *influence* relationships among the artists of *Modern Art*. The second is to use this graph along with graph theory to visualize, detect, and analyze the patterns of social relations in the network.  The fundamentals of this sort of SNA are detailed in a variety of sources dealing with SNA, as well as others dealing with more general network analysis and graph theory (including a short entry in one of my other repositories -- <a href='http://

While there are a variety of online sources providing data and information specifying and describing the relations of individual artists (working during various eras) there are few that have combined these "egocentric networks" into larger social networks in order to "detect and analyze the overall patterns in these networks."



So, the first goal of this project is to create a SNA graph of the *influence* relationships among the artists of *Modern Art* that can be used for SNA analysis and visualizati


Ultimately, the primary goal of our "processing pipeline" (to borrow a phrase from Goldfarb et.al.) is to use data from The ArtStory to create an SNA graph of the influences
